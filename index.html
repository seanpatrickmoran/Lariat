Kimchi

Alexander Grothendieck
One

Kimchi is a preparation of fermented vegetables, by a “lactic” fer­mentation like sauer­kraut, in the traditional Korean way. Kimchi is, along with rice, the staple of Korean cooking, where a meal (even a light one) is unthinkable without one or the other. This is equally true during the six months of the year in Korea where fresh vegetables are available, and accompany the meals together with Kimchi.

Since I learned how to prepare Kimchi, it has become a daily ingredient in my food and it is rare that I do not have one or more jars of Kimchi at my disposal. The advantages of Kimchi are numerous and obvious. Carefully prepared, it has an exquisite taste, refreshing in summer, stimulating in any season. Fermentation adds new qualities to vegetables, adding again to those of the fresh vegetables, aiding digestion and making an irreplaceable intestinal regulator; there is no contraindication even for sick people, on the contrary, apart from the fact that in some cases one will refrain from strongly spiced kimchi. With a (necessary) minimum of care, the preparation of Kimchi is one of the simplest, and in a few of the most pleasant hours of prep work one has at one’s disposition vegetables that are ready to be eaten—without any further preparation (cooking or otherwise)—for weeks or even months. (In Korea, the family Kimchi for winter is prepared around September, and constitutes the supply of consumable vegetables for the six months of the very harsh Korean winter.) It’s inexpensive food, because one can arrange to make a preparation with such vegetables, at the time when we have them in abundance.
Two

All vegetables are suitable for Kimchi, except starchy vegetables (potatoes, peas, beans). The vegetables most used in Korea are cabbages of all kinds, turnips, Chinese radishes, and cucumbers. With turnips and radishes, the leaves are also used—​ in general, the tops of almost all root vegetables (except potatoes and tomatoes) are good for consumption, and are in fact delicious. Thus onion and turnip greens, in addition to the bulbs of these vegetables, are a common ingredient for flavoring a “water” Kimchi. Traditionally Koreans do not use carrots or red beets to make their Kimchi, however I have made delicious Kimchis with both (For carrots, I was encouraged to do so, having learned that pickled carrots are common in Egypt.) Also Koreans use only one vegetable per jar of Kimchi (in addition to those added as herbs), however I have made some excellent mixes, notably turnips and carrots (this mixture also being Egyptian inspired). I made some Kimchi mixtures of turnips and red beets, but did not continue, because the very fine taste of the turnip was a bit drowned by the by the intense taste of the beet. It is good to handle combinations of flavor with care …

The essential ingredients of Kimchi are vegetables, salt, herbs, and (for water Kimchi), water. In addition to the necessary care, the quality of Kimchi depends on the quality of the ingredients—​ ensuring this quality is part of the care to be taken in the preparation of Kimchi. The role of salt and herbs, in addition to taste and dietary functions, is to act as moderator, to regulate the fermentation of the vegetable. Where possible one should avoid commercial white salt, and obtain raw salt (grey colored, if sea salt). Vegetables of the highest possible quality are used, given the source and freshness, removing any parts which are faded or doubtful (leaving them for soups or other culinary preparations for immediate consumption). There is no reluctance on the other hand to use the core of the cabbage, or the tail of the turnip, when these are healthy (as they should be for a healthy vegetable). For water, spring water (which is still abundant in Korea) is of course the best.

The traditional Korean spices for the preparation of Kimchi are garlic, fresh ginger and red pepper. The first two are must-haves in all Korean Kimchi, and it is rare for pepper to be absent in such a Kimchi. (Also Korean Kimchi is most often red or pink in color, and where pepper is absent it is called “white Kimchi”.) Korean red pepper is weaker than the pepper used in Europe, from Africa. The latter can irritate the intestinal mucosa, especially if it is absorbed regularly, which is why I have more or less given up on including it in the preparation of Kimchi. On the other hand, it is not always easy to get fresh ginger in Europe, and often it is quite expensive, especially outside big cities like Paris. Garlic remains the base flavor. One can additionally add, depending on taste and inspiration, any other locally available herb. Notably, I've used rosemary (in the Egyptian torchi Torshi is a dish of pickled vegetables common in Balkan and Middle Eastern countries. fennel, juniper berries (as for sauerkraut). In addition, in water Kimchis, one usually infuses onion, and onion or leek greens, cut into cylinders about 10 cm in length, of turnips and carrots), split longitudinally with a knife so the flavor of the herb better penetrates the surrounding water. Also, you can add some fresh or dried whole peppers to the jar, which contribute to the preservation of the Kimchi and give it a slightly spicier flavor, without risking an irritating effect like chili powder. As for garlic (and always for water Kimchi), each peeled clove is cut in half (or three, if it is large), and left to infuse in the jar, with the other spices. Spices are only crushed by mortar for waterless Kimchi.

The amount of salt and spices to add to a jar of Kimchi is adjusted to taste, which must be engaging, neither too strong nor too weak. It’s best to put too little at the start than too much, even adding more the next day, which presents no difficulty. A strongly salted and spiced Kimchi can be delicious, provided it is served as condiment (notably to accompany potatoes or grains), rather than as a dish of vegetables.
Three

The materials necessary for the preparation of Kimchi (apart from the ingredients just mentioned) are very simple. The most important is the earthenware or stoneware pot. It is good to have an assortment of different sizes, depending on quantities of available vegetables in different cases. In Korea family pots of 100 or 200 liters are common practice and they are inexpensive—​ for our use pots between 3 and 20 liters will undoubtedly work, we can find some commercially without much trouble (even placing an order if necessary), for prices varying according to size, from thirty to 200 francs. Lids should also be available for the pots, which should never be left open when in use. Plates generally work, and are preferable to wooden boards, which promote the appearance of mold. It is good when preparing the Kimchi to choose a pot of appropriate size, so that it is almost full and not only half full, to avoid much contact with air.

To draw Kimchi from the pot, use a wooden spatula or spoon for waterless Kimchi, a ladle (preferably wooden) for water Kimchi. The spoon and ladle must be clean and dry (wipe them after washing!), to avoid introducing parasitic fermentations into the pot and causing the Kimchi to “turn.” Do not use the same spoon or ladle for two or more pots of Kimchi, without having washed and dried it after each use. Avoid taking Kimchi with your hand in the pot, unless it has just been washed. When you have taken Kimchi in a bowl and it remains after the meal, do not put it back in the pot, but keep it to finish it at a following meal. It will keep for several days in a bowl without problem, while the Kimchi in the pot should keep for several weeks, even several months.

As material for the actual preparation, a board for cutting vegetables must be provided, a large kitchen knife, several buckets or large bowls for washing and kneading vegetables, one or two large round sieves made of woven straw or bamboo for drainage—​ you can find Chinese imports for twenty to thirty francs. I have two of them and even outside of the preparation of Kimchi, they are used almost every day, to wash vegetables or cereals, as fruit and vegetable baskets etc. Finally, for waterless Kimchis, you need a mortar with pestle to crush the salt and the spices together.
Four

The preparation and conservation of kimchi is one of the simplest things and there is no problem once you dedicate a minimum amount of intelligence and care to it. (Anyone who is not disposed to put in this minimum amount of investment would do better to feed themselves with preserved foods.) The first and foremost demand is cleanliness. All instruments used for the preparation and handling of Kimchi must be clean. More precisely, when you are preparing Kimchi, the pot that you are about to use must be washed carefully, both inside and outside, and dried on the inside with a clean towel. Likewise for the seals and bowls, the cutting board etc. The work surface must be free of all other objects when you are preparing Kimchi, and clean. Your hands and arms are clean, and especially when mixing the vegetables with the seasonings (in the case of Kimchi without water). You will avoid filling the pot to the brim, so that the plate-lid is not in contact with the Kimchi, and also to prevent the pot from overflowing after the “action” of the Kimchi in the first days.

In the days following the preparation of the Kimchi, while the fermentation is beginning, it is worth checking how it is proceeding, by stirring Kimchi with water to cause the vegetables that have floated to the surface to sink again and to prevent them from drying out or rotting, or by tamping (with a wooden spoon or a ladle, or with washed hands) Kimchi without water, so that the juice runs over the Kimchi, the top of which should stay wet. You should do this every one or two days. Once the Kimchi is ready to be eaten, it is enough to use the Kimchi regularly in order to guarantee that the slowed fermentation process will continue properly, without the appearance of any parasitic fermentation, and especially of any moulds. The sign of a successful fermentation is a fresh, appetising smell, never a foul smell. When you have not taken any Kimchi out of a pot for a while, it is good to spend a few minutes stirring Kimchi with water, tamping Kimchi without water, and, if necessary, turning over the Kimchi on the surface of the pot to moisten the part that would have tended to dry out. The appearance of a veil of mould is not a catastrophe, it is absorbed without difficulty in the mass of Kimchi when it is caught in time, and does not alter its flavour. On the other hand, a Kimchi which is neglected for more than a week, or for several weeks, is at serious risk of spoiling. And as a consequence, it is good to make arrangements when you must be absent for a duration of more than a week.

You must allow, according to the season and the temperature, for several days (perhaps up to ten or so) from the day of preparation before the Kimchi is ready (incidentally, it is pleasant to eat right from the beginning, but less good than after the fermentation has continued for a while). When it is ready, it is preferable to store the Kimchi in a cool location, to avoid too fast a fermentation. Refrigerators are not to be used. On the other hand, in the middle of summer, lacking a cool cellar, you can put the pot in a bowl with some water, place a towel on top, and leave the ends of the towel soaking in the bowl, which suffices to prevent the Kimchi from “cooking” in the pot. In summer in Korea, people too poor to have a cellar bury their pots in the ground, leaving only the neck sticking out, which suffices to keep them at the necessary temperature.

When the amount of Kimchi in the pot gets low, make sure that there is no Kimchi stuck to the sides of the pot above the level of the mass of Kimchi, by bringing it back towards the main mass with a wooden spoon or a ladle.

As the fermentation progresses, over the span of weeks or months, the flavour of the Kimchi becomes stronger naturally, without actually turning foul. Some prefer Kimchi to be more fermented, some prefer it less fermented. For those who don't like Kimchi in a very acidic state, I highlight that they may “extend” it by using it particularly in soups. Kimchi soups are very pleasant soups, you can put in (as well as Kimchi) absolutely anything you like: fresh or dried vegetables, various grains, meat, fish—​ the result is always a nice surprise. You can make substantial soups that remain fresh for several days without a problem. It is also popular in Korea to take highly fermented Kimchi and re-fry it, but keep in mind that this will have a tendency to further concentrate the flavours, unless you mix the Kimchi with other ingredients.

In principle, a Kimchi carefully prepared and carefully handled will not go bad. The Korean friend who taught me the art of Kimchi confirms that she has never seen a Kimchi spoil in Korea, or heard of any such thing happening, and I believe her freely, since Kimchi is a foundational element of a thousand-year-old culture there. I have been practising Kimchi for six years, and on two occasions (in the beginning stages) I have had a Kimchi go bad: once I had to throw it away after several days, whereas the other time, the situation could be salvaged. There have also been one or two times when I have had to throw away the ends of pots that I had forgotten a little. If a Kimchi has suffered any misfortune (which happens sometimes here!), it is often possible to salvage the situation—​ one way is to add some salt, some seasonings, or both; another, to put it in the cold.
Five

It remains for me to give instructions for the actual preparation, distinguishing the two cases, with or without water. In both cases, the vegetables must first be washed very carefully. With plenty of water, brush the root vegetables and cut and detach the leaves from the leafy vegetables, in a way that ensures a thorough cleaning. At the same time, all wilted, wormy, or otherwise questionable parts of the vegetable are to be removed. There is no question of peeling the root vegetables, the skin of which is an inseparable ingredient. Then cut the vegetables. The fineness of the cutting is not dictated; the Korean custom is to cut the leaves significantly less than in sauerkraut, and to cut the roots into small sticks, two or three times larger than fries. The coarser the cutting, the slower the fermentation. For cucumbers, the fermentation of which is generally very rapid, we sometimes limit ourselves to cutting each cucumber into four quarters. For green tomatoes, generally intended to be kept for several months, even all winter, they are sometimes left whole. (Red tomatoes are not suitable for the preparation of Kimchi, as fermentation tends to reduce them to mush.) Of course, the shape of the cut is a matter of tradition, and the bacteria, I think, don't care—​ thus in Egypt, carrots are cut into rings, not into sticks.

The simplest preparation is Kimchi with water. We put the cut vegetables in a jar so that it is more or less full, cover them with cool water, add salt (to taste), and then the aromatics, as explained in part 2. If you have ginger, just cut it into thin strips, without crushing them with a mortar. We cover the jar, put it in a suitable quiet place, and we’re done.

For Kimchi without water, you must first crush the aromatics in a mortar. I crush them together with salt, which facilitates the formation of the aromatic paste through simultaneous grinding. When it comes to vegetables without leaves, i.e. only roots, one mixes the cut vegetables with the ground herbs and salt in a bowl, doing it several times over if necessary, carefully piling up and tamping the mixed vegetables in the pot. One then rinses the mortar and the bowl with about half a glass of water, as well as one’s hands, so as to recover all the spices; the water collected at the bottom of the bowl is then poured over the vegetables in the pot and is used to initiate fermentation. If the vegetables are dry enough, we will then be more generous with the amount of water with aromatics added to begin.

The process is the same for Kimchi without water made with leafy vegetables, except that there is an additional step in the preparation, which is very important. This step is essential in particular to ensure normal fermentation. We pile up the leaves which we have washed and possibly cut (in the case of large-sized leaves) in one or more bowls or pails, sprinkling them with salt as we go and tamping the leaves well, especially if they are rather rough. It may also be good to sprinkle them with a little water (in a bowl next to you) as you pile up the leaves in the container. Then cover with the inverted sieve, or with a cloth, and let it sit for a few hours, or one night at most. The purpose of this operation is to let the salt begin to enter the leaf to wilt it. (It can be useful, after a few hours, to turn the vegetables over, so that the salt water accumulated at the bottom passes over the vegetables again, if they aren’t “drooping” enough yet.) By this method, the vegetables are compacted and will go in the jar more easily, and start to make juice as soon as you squeeze them by pushing down on them. However, the leaves should not be left to macerate for so long in the bowl, that they already begin to produce their own juice, which would then be lost.

When the leaves have macerated enough, wash them in plenty of water, and drain them through a sieve or sieves. The salt used in the preliminary maceration is thus lost—​ you should not think about using the salt water at the bottom of the bowl for the Kimchi we’re going to prepare! Once the leaves are drained, we mix them with the spices and put them in jars as before.

It is even more important here to pack the leaves well in the jar, as we pile them up, by pressing them down with our fists and all our weight, or with a wooden ladle. There must indeed be no air trapped in the mass of Kimchi (this also applies to root vegetables), and moreover, the vegetable juice must come out enough to cover the entire surface of the vegetable. It is common in Korea, for some vegetables composed of roots and leaves, such as radishes, not to separate the roots from the leaves, therefore macerating the roots at the same time as the attached tops. This makes a particularly appetizing Kimchi, for both the eye and for the mouth. The difficulty, however, comes in piling these vegetables in the jar, both without crushing them and without leaving an air pocket anywhere. This is how I had misfortune with a jar of Chinese radish Kimchi that started to turn. I managed to fix it by separating the leaves and roots, recutting the roots etc. … this is one of the two cases discussed above. Subsequently, I have preferred to prepare the roots and the tops separately.

For cucumbers, which are vegetables that are easily crushed, mixing them with the spices must be done with delicacy, as well as putting them in the jar, under risk of reducing them to a pulp. Cucumber Kimchi tends to ferment quickly and it’s not a question of making a Kimchi out of them with a long shelf life, except for leaving them whole, or possibly accompanied by green tomatoes. When it comes to using cucumbers cut into sticks, it will hardly keep more than one or two weeks, and the question of air pockets arises very little, especially since it settles by itself without having to press with any effort. Cucumber Kimchi is particularly delicious. Towards the end it tends to go a little mushy, which gives it a less appetizing appearance, while its taste is still delicious. The best thing is to use it in soups, which get a very refreshing and delicate taste, thanks to the fermented cucumbers.
Six

As is no doubt clear from all the above, Kimchi is intended in principle to be eaten as is, without cooking beforehand, to accompany rice or other grains, or starches like beans or potatoes. The liquid from water Kimchi is particularly delicious, and may be drunk separately from a bowl or glass; one takes care however to always leave enough juice in the pot so that the vegetables remain entirely covered. Koreans eat Kimchi in a bowl, while rice (well softened) is served on plates and eaten with a spoon. There is nothing wrong of course with mixing different Kimchis on one’s plate or bowl, on the other hand there is no question of mixing one pot of Kimchi with another (for example two pots which are nearly finished) any more than one may use an old Kimchi to “start” the fermentation of a new one. Fermentation starts itself by the action of bacteria in the air.

For a Kimchi of green tomatoes or whole cucumbers, the most pleasant presentation for the meal is to cut the vegetable in thin slices, which better brings out the delicacy of the flavor. When it comes to infusions of short duration, one serves the vegetable in the liquid in which it was steeped. For longer infusions, one must make saltier brines, unfit for consumption, especially as after a few months they take on a slightly brackish taste. Koreans are thus used to serving green tomatoes or cucumbers in a salad bowl, cut into thin slices, with fresh spring water added upon serving. The flavor of the vegetable immediately diffuses in the water and gives it a delicious taste, at the same time the flavor of the vegetable itself becomes less concentrated. Served differently, it instead takes the form of a condiment, like pickles.
Seven

“Sweet Kimchi”. This is a misnomer, for a preparation of fruits and vegetables of Japanese origin, not Korean. The traditional preparation was given to me by a Buddhist monk friend—​ it is a mixture of approximately equal parts apples, carrots, onions, cut into slices to which one adds a good quantity of white sugar (on the order of a quarter or a fifth of the total volume), all in an earthenware pot. Within several hours, the sugar extracting the juice of the fruit and vegetables, the preparation begins to bathe in its own juice. A little like salt in Kimchi, the essential role of sugar is to guarantee good preservation of the mix, and in this case to prevent alcoholic fermentation. The preparation obtained can be kept long enough, and is used as tonic—especially the liquid.

Before learning this recipe, I was making similar preparations with only apples or all other types of fruit, with sugar—it’s especially useful for preserving fruit which are likely to spoil. For apples, pears, plums, quince etc, one cuts them into slices to allow the sugar to penetrate and extract the juice; for cherries one crushes them a bit in the sugar to start the process of juice formation. The idea is to make a sort of jam, without cooking. One of the advantages over traditional jam is that one uses significantly less sugar, moreover the white sugar is transformed under the action of enzymes in the fruit into less aggressive and more assimilable sugars, with a sweeter taste (glucose, fructose etc)—​ on the whole the original scent of the fruit is preserved nearly intact. On the other hand the preservation is shorter than for jams, mainly due to the fact that the upper part of the pot leaves the fruit (which float in the liquid) in contact with the air. Without putting in more sugar, it ends with alcoholic fermentation, generally after several weeks. One might either let this continue, and harvest a fruit liqueur; or decant the liquid in bottles (and drink it as a more or less full-bodied apéritif depending on the degree of fermentation), and cook the fruit over very low heat (without necessarily bringing it to a boil), so as to evaporate the alcoholic vapors. One may thus preserve the fruit so treated as jam, it has a more delicate flavor because the scent of the fruit remained intact.

“Sweet Kimchi” can be eaten as a dessert, adding a few drops of lemon juice if necessary to increase the acidity level. It can also be used for delicious drinks, or to prepare infusions by adding boiling water to it in a bowl.

After learning about the Japanese preparation apples-carrots-onions, I made a good number of “sweet Kimchi” with mixtures of fruit and all sorts of vegetables—including carrots, turnips, red cabbage, celery root, kohlrabi A “German turnip” … The onion is in any case a particularly fortuitous ingredient, giving the preparation a cachet not replicable with any other vegetable. One can add any aromatic of one’s choice, notably ginger, or finely cut lemon peel. I also sometimes added crushed peanuts. I have had no disappointments with any “sweet Kimchi” that I’ve made so far, I found them all very good, up to the last at the bottom of the pots or bottles, and it was the same with occasional visitors who tasted them. The common quality to these preparations and of Kimchi itself, is it allows an unlimited range for the initiative and the imagination of those who do them, with considerable flexibility of use, which always lets one make the most of the particular resources available at the moment.
